# _**KenzieFlow**_

Kenzie Flow is a free time tracker/break balancer for all Kenzie students to track their daily tasks and stop procrastinating
<br>
<br>
<br>

## TODOs

- Display messages of fun stuff to do/read/watch on breaks

- Timer animation (bar that spans across page as timer gets near the end)

- Track the tasks the user writes in (to-do list)

- Work with Slack to change their status to either working or breaking

  - Sets to either Working, On a Short Break, or On a Long Break
  - If working notifications are disabled (?)

- Settings tab to change timing (ASK!)

## ISSUES

- Compatibility (safari)
- Footer border collides with Long break button
- Variable names not unique enough (maybe?)
- Navbar doesn't span the full length on 000webhost (ASK!)
